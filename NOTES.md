# Notes

- colect extensions that does similar thing and compare it to Mosaic model:
    - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dualless/bgdpkilkheacbboffppjgceiplijhfpd
- Tile persistance
    - well, I loose all my tiles when I do a refresh :(
- Find on a page (⌘F)
    - implemented in a copy cat fashion not to alienate people
    - instead it might focus URL bar with `[In Page]` pill in front of a blinking cursor and search icon somewhere near-by
    - use via "!inpage" bang
- Switch tiles by dragging?
    - alt dragging one tile over the other and releasing, could rearrange tiles so that they will switch the places
    - scenario:
        1. I have screen with Reddit and Work shared as 1:2 (terrible idea, but the idea is you won't fall into uninterupted procrastination cycle if you'll keep disruptor present)
        2. Alt-dragging Reddit onto a work tile
        3. Now I have Reddit 2 times bigger than work (again, keeping the disruptor present)
- There is no indicator/screen when there is no tile present
- Picture in Picture? Not for video, but as a floating tile
- Zen mode – temporary showing only single tile
- Adding "+" button for new tab in the stack would be nice
- Visual non-linear history
    - I want to see a high-level nodes-and-edges visualization of my browsing history – it is going to be probably a let down.

## Crazy ideas
- **Keeping history in Git** – Might have super interesting consequences.
- **Built-in web server** – Opera had built-in web server, which was über cool! Chrome has DevTools that are super powerful. Marrying the two might end up looking like this:
    1. I open new tile, pull up DevTools for that blank page. Edit source of it, e.g. add `<h1>Hello world</h1>` to it, push a toolbar button called "Live Share" and bam – I've got shareable URL that I can send to Steve. Steve opens it and see page with a header spelling "Hello world". Then I switch to DevTools and change word "world" to "Mosaic". Steve immediatelly see the change on his end.
    2. I'll add `<form><input /><button /></form>` and some action logic, and surprise, surprise Steve's hitting of a button will deliver the message "somehow" to me. Absolutely no idea how to do it.
    3. Already exists – https://beakerbrowser.com/
        - uses `hyper` P2P protocol, not HTTP, otherwise extra cool
- **Integrated BOINC** – Enabled by default without switch is bleh. Enabled with switch doesn't sound really nice. Maybe "share your CPU for Science" :D Not really. It is a bad idea.
- **Visual clipboard** – drag&drop into clipboard situated in a near-by panel. Should be great for researching stuff.
- **Social browsing** – you'll be able to interact with people visiting the same site in real-time.
- **Visual non-linear history** – history that can branch like a git repo, always preserved navigation metadata, i.e. answering questions like *"How did I get there?"*, *"What did I do there?"*.
