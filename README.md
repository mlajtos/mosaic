## Value proposition

The main value of using Mosaic over Chrome with builtin macOS tiling can be seen on this non-exhaustive list of tasks that often pop up when you want to use web in a tiling fashion:

1. **Task 1** – create a 1:2 splitscreen from a single fullscreen window containing two tabs
   - Chrome on macOS – [video, 12 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acpdYwx13tM)
     1. turn-off fullscreen
     1. tear off one tab into a window
     1. hold cursor over green (maximise) window button
     1. select "Tile window to the left side"
     1. choose the second Chrome window to fill the rest of the screen (right side)
     1. resize via the splitter between the tiles
   - Mosaic on macOS – [video, 6 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBIxEerWKbQ)
     1. drag out a tab to the wanted place
        - 🤬 the animation is extremely choppy 
     1. resize via the splitter between the tiles
2. **Task 2** – interact with unfocused tile and repeat
   - Chrome on macOS – [video, 5 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGHneorb0Xc)
     1. move cursor over unfocused tile
     1. click on the unfocused tile to focus it
     1. click on the interactive element
     1. [repeat]
   - Mosaic on macOS – [video, 2 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej-0LTTm_yQ)
     1. move cursor over unfocused tile
        - 🤬 tile did not change the appearance to communicate focus
     1. click on the interactive element
     1. [repeat]
